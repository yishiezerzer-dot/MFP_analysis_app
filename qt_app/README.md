# Qt App (PySide6)

This folder contains a minimal PySide6 entrypoint that mirrors the existing Tkinter tabs as placeholders.

## Run (Windows)

1. Ensure PySide6 is installed:
   - `pip install PySide6`

2. From the repository root, run:
   - `python -m qt_app.main`

The Qt version currently contains placeholder tabs and stub workspace actions.
